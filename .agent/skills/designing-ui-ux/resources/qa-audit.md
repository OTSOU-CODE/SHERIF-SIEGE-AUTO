# Design Quality Assurance & Continuous Improvement

## Comprehensive Visual Audit

- [ ] **Cross-Device Screenshots**: Capture screenshots at all major breakpoints and themes.
- [ ] **Component Library Documentation**: Create a living style guide with code examples.
- [ ] **Design System Consistency Check**: Verify spacing, color, and typography compliance.

## Analytical Design Review

- [ ] **Heuristic Evaluation**: Assess against Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit**: Run automated tests (axe DevTools, Lighthouse) and manual testing.
- [ ] **Performance Analysis**: Use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Chrome DevTools.

## Structured Feedback & Iteration

- [ ] **Strengths Documentation**: Compile list of successful patterns.
- [ ] **Prioritized Improvements**: Generate actionable recommendations (high/medium/low impact).
- [ ] **A/B Testing Opportunities**: Identify areas for experimentation.
- [ ] **User Testing Insights**: Incorporate usability testing findings and analytics.

## Design Debt Management

- [ ] **Technical Debt Tracking**: Document inconsistencies, hacks, and refactoring needs.
- [ ] **Future-Proofing**: Ensure design system is scalable.
- [ ] **Version Control for Design**: Maintain design iteration history.
