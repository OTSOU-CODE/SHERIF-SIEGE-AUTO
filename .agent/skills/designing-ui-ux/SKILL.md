# Modern Design & UX Excellence Framework

This skill provides a rigorous standard for creating world-class web experiences. It covers everything from visual polish to technical performance.

## When to use this skill

- When designing a new feature or page.
- When conducting a UI/UX audit.
- When the user asks to make the site "look modern" or "feel premium".
- When fixing responsiveness or accessibility issues.

## Workflow & Resources

This framework is divided into 5 specialist areas. Consult the relevant resource for your current task.

### 1. Visual Design & Aesthetics

For color harmony, typography, gradients, shadows, and component consistency:
👉 **[`resources/visual-design.md`](resources/visual-design.md)**

### 2. Responsiveness & Layout

For mobile-first strategies, fluid grids, breakpoints, and touch optimization:
👉 **[`resources/responsive-arch.md`](resources/responsive-arch.md)**

### 3. Interaction & Motion

For micro-interactions, animations, navigation patterns, and feedback states:
👉 **[`resources/interaction-design.md`](resources/interaction-design.md)**

### 4. Technical Implementation

### 5. Quality Assurance & Audit

## Core Principles

1.  **Aesthetics are Functional**: A beautiful interface builds trust.
2.  **Performance is UX**: A slow premium site is not premium.
3.  **Accessibility is Default**: Inclusive design is better design for everyone.
